# Railways network

A test problem solving task to simulate movement of the trains along railways.

● You are given 3 railways with train stations

● There is a single train on each rail

● Each train can carry n passengers

● Upon reaching a terminus station, a train will change direction

● All trains take the same amount of time from one station to another
